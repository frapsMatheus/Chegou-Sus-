#CADE_SUS

Android project for the first Cotidiano Hackathon. This is an app using firebase to notify the community when a prescription drug has arrived at any of the distribution Hospitals. It uses the realtime database so that the users can see live when the drug that they are waiting for has arrived and how many units are available.
